Here are the instructions.

To start off playing this game, you need to know the following theorems
about "mynat", the natural numbers we are building:

zero_ne_succ : ∀ (a : mynat), zero ≠ succ(a)
succ_inj : ∀ {a b : mynat}, succ(a) = succ(b) → a = b
add_zero : ∀ a : mynat, a + 0 = a
add_succ : ∀ a b : mynat, a + succ(b) = succ(a + b)

Some occasionally useful other results are:

one_eq_succ_zero : 1 = succ 0
ne_iff_implies_false : a ≠ b ↔ (a = b) → false

You also need to know that the principle of mathematical induction works.

To play, you will also need to know at least some of the following tactics:

exact
assumption
refl
induction
cases
rw (and rw ... at ...)
symmetry
split
intro
revert
apply
exfalso
