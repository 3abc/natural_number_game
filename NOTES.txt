The golden rule is that that the user should never have to apply
recursion, just induction. So results like zero_ne_succ and
succ_inj, which are basically supplied by the compiler but which
are proved using recursion, are given to them for free.

We use a modded tactic mode [less_leaky] where we've changed
rw, cases, induction and we propose changing symmetry
