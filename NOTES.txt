comments from KB to KB:

The golden rule is that that the user should never have to apply
recursion, just induction. So results like zero_ne_succ and
succ_inj, which are basically supplied by the compiler but which
are proved using recursion, are given to them for free.

We use a modded tactic mode [less_leaky] where we've changed
rw, cases, induction, and we propose changing symmetry at some point.



TODO: add odd/even level. Add other inequality level?

Note:

* The theorem `one_eq_succ_zero : 1 = succ 0`
  * The theorem `ne_iff_implies_false : a ≠ b ↔ (a = b) → false`

those are currently undocumented. As is `symmetry`, `rw \l`.
