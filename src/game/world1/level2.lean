## Tutorial world, level 2: the `exact` tactic.

Delete the `sorry` below and let's look at the box
on the top right. It should look like this:

```
a b : mynat,
h : a = b
‚ä¢ a = b
```

So here `a` and `b` are natural numbers,
we have a hypothesis `h` that `a = b` (think of
`h` as a *proof* that `a = b`), and our
goal is to prove that `a = b`. 

We're hence in a situation where we have a hypothesis `h`,
which is *exactly* equal to the goal we're trying to prove. In
this situation, the tactic

`exact h,`

will close the goal. Try typing `exact h,` where the `sorry` was, and
hit enter after the comma to go onto a new line. 
**Don't forget the `h`** and
**don't forget the comma.**
You should see the "no goals" message, and the error
in the bottom right goal will disappear. The reason
this works is that the goal is *exactly h*.

For all natual numbers $a$ and $b$,
if $a=b$, then $a=b$.

lemma example2 (a b : mynat) (h : a = b): a = b :=
begin [less_leaky]
  exact h

These two tactics, `refl` and `exact`, clearly only
have limited capabilities by themselves. The next
tactic we will learn, the rewrite tactic `rw`, is far more powerful.
