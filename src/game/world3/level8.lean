# Multiplication World

## Level 8: `mul_comm`

Finally, the boss level of multiplication world. But (assuming you
didn't cheat) you are well-prepared for it -- you have `zero_mul`
and `mul_zero`, as well as `succ_mul` and `mul_succ`. After this
level you can of course throw away one of each pair if you like,
but I would recommend you hold on to them, sometimes it's convenient
to have exactly the right tools to do a job.

/- Lemma
Multiplication is commutative.

lemma mul_comm (a b : mynat) : a * b = b * a :=
begin [less_leaky]
  induction b with d hd,
  { 
    rw zero_mul,
    rw mul_zero,
    refl,
  },
  {
    rw succ_mul,
    rw ‚Üêhd,
    rw mul_succ,
    refl,

You've now proved that the natural numbers are a "commutative semiring"!
There are now two paths you can take. You can play it safe and move
straight on to Power World by selecting "Next World" in the top right,
or you can push further into uncharted
(i.e. currently poorly documented) territory and see if you can solve
some harder levels in multiplication world, by selecting "Next Level".
If you stay in multiplication world, there are three more levels,
and you will need tactics such as `intro`, `cases` and `exfalso`.
These tactics are explained in the
<a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/html/source/tactics/tacticindex.html" target="blank">tactic guide</a>.
