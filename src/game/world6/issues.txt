CHECK: IMPORTANT World 5 and 6 left menu is filling up with crap.

5-1 "let and apply" -> "have and apply".

"Note that exact h(P), won't work (say "CAPITAL P")

5-2 "3*n+2" -> 3n+2

just above lemma remark that i impotred mul.

5-3 put p \in P into the crap diagram

..finish the level with

exact u,

.

5-4 "using lets -> using haves"

5-5 "frmo world 2" -> "from level 2"

lemma statement "whatever sets are" -> "whatever the sets..."

5-6 I write "have j : Q -> R := f p" but I think this is the first
time I wrote the type of the term after j.

5-8 "1 goal" -- not there for me.

Notation for empty set on line 2

"so we are doing some kind of proof by contradiction at this point"

5-9 You can of course work both forwards and backwards. Or you can
just crack and draw a picture.

Aftter proof: the tactics are indeed good enoough.

6-1 -> "distinhuishing the concept of a proposition and its proof."

"intro, exact, appl" -> "exact, intro, have, apply"

Lemma: "and P -> Q is true"

6-2 "which is what solvign a goal mean -> solving this goal means"

"To define an implication P -> Q Â£ -- \implies

"So either believe in Goedel... -- delete"

6-3 exact u, on newline at end.

"If you solved the level using let" -> "have, then click on the word
"exact" and l.v. ...

Lemma: THEY ARE TYPES. Example in text: STILL TYPES

6-5 "tactic from world 2" -> "level 2"
THEY ARE TYPES AND EXAMPLES ARE TYPES

6-9 "they will be the last -> the last tactics you will need to know
in order to become a competent Lean user. Indeed, after working through
the rest of proposition world (which KB hasn't written yet) you
should have all the tools you need to solve all the levels in advanced
addition world, advanced multiplication world, and the 30 levels of
inequality world.


5-1 we're linear. When can we be nonlinear?
