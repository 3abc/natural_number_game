## Level 8: `eq_zero_of_add_right_eq_self`

The lemma you're about to prove will be useful when we want to prove that $\leq$ is antisymmetric.
There are some wrong paths that you can take with this one.

/- Lemma
If $a$ and $b$ are natural numbers such that 
$$ a + b = a, $$
then $b = 0$.

lemma eq_zero_of_add_right_eq_self {{a b : mynat}} : a + b = a â†’ b = 0 :=
begin [less_leaky]
