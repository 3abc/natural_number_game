Until Mohammad's refactor we are stuck with being linear.

world1 = Tutorial World
world2 = basic addition world
world3 = basic multiplication world
world4 = power world
world5 will soon be function world
world6 will be proposition world
world 7 is then advanced addition world
world 8 advanced multiplcation world
world 9 inequality world (full 30 levels)

That's the goal of v1.1

and then we can add advanced other worlds
and it would be nice if we could be more nonlinear
because I am happy for someone to do world 5 directly after world 2, then 6 then 7 but then they must do world 3 before world 8
