Until Mohammad's refactor we are stuck with being linear.

world1 = Tutorial World
world2 = basic addition world
world3 = basic multiplication world
world4 = power world
world5 is now function world
world6 proposition world but we have 0 levels
world7 advanced prop world
world8 is then advanced addition world (7-16 or whatever)
world9 advanced multiplcation world (there were only a few?)
world10 inequality world (full 30 levels)
w10 collectible: proof that natural numbers are some totally_ordered_semiring or
whatever nonsense.

w11:even and odd. 
That's the goal of v1.1
