Until Mohammad's refactor we are stuck with being linear.

world1 = Tutorial World
world2 = basic addition world
world3 = basic multiplication world
world4 = power world
world5 is now function world
world6 will be proposition world but we have 0 levels
world 7 is then advanced addition world (7-16 or whatever)
world 8 advanced multiplcation world (there were only a few?)
world 9 inequality world (full 30 levels)
plus proof that natural numbers are some totally_ordered_semiring or
whatever nonsense.

That's the goal of v1.1

TODO : if Mohammad has not non-lineared the game then we want to give
the user the choice of jumping from world 2 to worlds 5,6,7 before world 3
